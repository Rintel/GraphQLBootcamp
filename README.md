# GraphQLBootcamp

This Repo holds my first steps trying out GraphQL, it's fully work in progress at the moment and will be updated by the time goes on.

## Reasons for GraphQL?
1) GraphQL is fast
2) GraphQL is flexible
3) GraphQL is easy to maintain

## Setup GraphQL
- install Node v.8 or higher
- GraphQL for VSCode (quite handy)
