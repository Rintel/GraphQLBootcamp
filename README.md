# GraphQLBootcamp

This Repo holds my first steps trying out GraphQL, it's fully work in progress at the moment and will be updated by the time goes on.

I'm using this docs: https://facebook.github.io/graphql/June2018/

## Reasons for GraphQL?
1) GraphQL is fast
2) GraphQL is flexible
3) GraphQL is easy to maintain

## Setup GraphQL
- install Node v.8 or higher
- GraphQL for VSCode (quite handy) 
- go to subfolder graphql-basics and run `npm install`

## Run GraphQL
- run `npm run start`
- visit `localhost:4000`
